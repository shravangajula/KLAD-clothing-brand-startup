Market Research

Introduction
After developing our initial Business Model Canvas (BMC) for our tailored clothing startup with AR/VR integration, we conducted market research to gather insights from potential customers. This process involved explaining our BMC concept in class and then going out to ask different customers about their shopping preferences and experiences. Based on the feedback we received, we iteratively refined our BMC to better align with customer needs and expectations.

Initial Customer Interviews
Methodology
We approached a diverse group of customers, including frequent online shoppers, fashion enthusiasts, and individuals who prefer in-person shopping. Our goal was to understand their preferences, challenges, and expectations when it comes to buying clothes online and in physical stores.

Insights Gathered
The feedback from customers highlighted several key points:

Fit and Sizing Issues: Many customers expressed frustration with fit and sizing inconsistencies, leading to frequent returns.
Reluctance to Try New Brands: Poor past experiences with new brands deterred customers from experimenting with other options.
Lack of Confidence in Online Shopping: Some customers avoided online shopping due to the inability to try on clothes and make confident purchasing decisions.
Interest in Customization: There was significant interest in custom-tailored clothing to ensure a better fit.
Positive AR/VR Experiences: Customers who had used AR/VR technology for shopping, particularly for items like eyewear and sneakers, found it convenient and helpful.
Iterative Refinement of the BMC

Based on initial feedback, we made the following changes to our BMC:

Value Propositions: Emphasized the benefits of custom-tailored clothing and the convenience of AR/VR technology for virtual try-ons.
